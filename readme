This is my first attempt at making a discord clone.

Things to change:

- Making the page responsive
- ~~ Adding and input to set the initial username ~~
- Randomising the unique id (eg "#4123")
- Adding an input to set the pfp and also setting the object name for the image
- Adding checks for the username; makes sure the field isnt empty or just spaces, make sure the username isnt too long
- Add a way to change the username without having to reload

Recent changed:

- Added setting username
